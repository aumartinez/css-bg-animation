## Spheres calm background animation

An implementation on a background animation using only CSS keyframes properties.

Notice: To apply 2 animation properties or transform properties to the same object, it is better to apply the transform transition to different element wrapper/containers, it may lead to undesired/unpredicted results trying to combine 2 or more transform properties at once.

Then, the animation applies the transition (move to up) to a wrapper and the scaling transition to the "bubble/sphere" element.

A sample implementation of this animation is available to review at:
